This is a python program utilizing logistic regression model to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. Logistic regression algorithm is a binary classifier that learns a linear decision boundary. 
The data are split into two subsets, a training set in file named train_cancer.csv, and a test set in file named test_cancer_pub.csv

Below is the attributes in the dataset.
attribute name | type | values
clump thickness: numerical. 1~10
uniformity of cell size: numerical. 1~10
uniformity of cell shape: numerical. 1~10
marginal adhesion: numerical. 1~10
single epithelial cell size: numerical. 1~10
bland chromatin: numerical. 1~10
normal nucleoli: numerical. 1~10
mitoses: numerical. 1~10
tumor: numerical. Either 0 (represents benign) or 1 (represents malignant)

The program will read two csv files named: train_cancer.csv, test_cancer_pub.csv and generate an output file named: test_predicted.csv

Install the numpy and matplotlib packages by using the below command
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib

Use the below command to run the program
python logreg.py
